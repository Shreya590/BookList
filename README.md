# BookList
Android BookList app built in kotlin that fetches books data with Retrofit and displays Robert Martin book list to users. This App follow MVVM architecture and API calls in Repository.I have also used Json Files and wrote test cases.

MVVM Architecture :
MVVM is one of the architectural patterns which enhances separation of concerns, it allows separating the user interface logic from the business (or the back-end) logic. Its target (with other MVC patterns goal) is to achieve the following principle "Keeping UI code simple and free of app logic in order to make it easier to manage".

Retrofit :
Retrofit is a type-safe REST client for Android, Java and Kotlin developed by Square. The library provides a powerful framework for authenticating and interacting with APIs and sending network requests with OkHttp.
